Abstract:

Measuring Oxygenation of blood (SaO2) plays a vital role in patient's health monitoring. This
is often measured by pulse oximeter, which is standard measure during anesthesia, asthma,
operative and post-operative recoveries. Despite all, monitoring Oxygen level is necessary for
infants with respiratory problems, old people, and pregnant women and in other critical situa-
tions.

This project discusses the process of calculating the level of oxygen in blood and heart-rate
detection using a non-invasive photo plethysmography also called as pulse oximeter designed
using the Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020 FPGA and optical nger probe. The Serial Peripheral Interface
is established between the ARM and the Digilent Pmod A/D & D/A converter. The probe uses
infrared and red LED lights to measure and oxygen saturation in our body. The percentage of
oxygen in the body is worked by measuring the intensity from each frequency of light after it
transmits through the body and then calculating the ratio between these two intensities.
